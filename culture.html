        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <p>Filipino people have many traditions, customs, and superstitions that render the filipino culture quite unique. Many of these can be traced back to Spanish colonial times, while others are general fears for future outcomes. Below are some examples of inherently Filipino practices and beliefs.</p>
        <span class="block">

        <ul>
          <h3>The "Debut"</h3>
          <p>The Filipino debut is a coming of age party for young women turning 18 years old. It is highly comparable to the Spanish Quinceñera coming of age party that takes place on a Spanish young lady's 15th birthday. The Filipino debut most likely was influenced by this Spanish Quinceñera, since the Philippines was colonized by the Spanish for ~400 years.</p>

          <h3>Food</h3>
          <p>The main value when it comes to Filipino cuisine is that nothing must go unwasted. Traditional Filipino food honors this value, as many of our traditional meals are based on typically unwanted animal parts such as intestines, hearts, livers, stomach lining, and even blood. Meat is huge in the Philippines. Vegetables and even fruit come pretty secondary to meat, which is almost always accompanied by a plate of jasmine rice.</p>

          <h3>Death and Funerals</h3>
          <p>In Filipino culture, the deceased are honored by holding a large party with food, kareoke, and in many cases, dancing. Food plays a particularly large role in these parties. Large amounts of food are made to both feed the guests at the party, as well as to disperse in to-go packages for families in the surrounding neighborhood. Small portions of the food are set aside on a table as an offering to the deceased, and are left there for the entire duration of the event.</p>
          <p>When someone in your family passes, you wear white, especially on funeral day. Immediate family of the deceased (e.g. Mother, child) wear a small white band around their forehead, sometimes for weeks. On funeral day, the casket is carried to the nearby cemetery, and loved ones follow the casket on the street by foot, all the way to the cemetery where the body is buried. Music is played on a speaker while the people walk.</p>

          <h3>Christmas</h3>
          <p>Christmas is a huge celebration in the Philippines. In fact, it holds the world record for the longest celebrated Christmas season, starting from September, lasting until February. The real Christmas celebrations occur over the span of about a week, where dances, parties, and dinners are held throughout the communities.</p>
          <span class="block">
          </span>
          <h3>Kareoke</h3>
          <p>Kareoke is an essential part of any celebration or get together. For parties, large kareoke machines are often rented for the day, hooked up outdoors, and serve as the main entertainment for guests. On a more casual basis, Filipino families often own their own home kareoke sets with amplifiers, and are sung for hours during the day. It is extremely common to hear a house singing kareoke houses down from yours during the day, loud and clear. Oftentimes you can hear multiple houses singing kareoke at the same time.</p>

          <h3>Superstitions</h3>
          <p>This is by no means an extensive list of Filipino superstitions, and they may also vary by region. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>"If you sing at the dinner table you'll marry a poor old man."</li>
              <li>"When a person is grieving, they may become particularly affectionate/fond of you during that time. Bad things will start to happen to you unless each time you see them they put their hand on your head before you leave."</li>
              <li>"It is bad luck to have the ends of serving utensils face you at the dinner table."</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
