            <p>There is no exclusive Filipino language. About 180 different languages are spoken throughout the country, depending on the region. Today, "Filipino" is the name for the official national language of the Philippines. However, this title is fairly recent. "Filipino" only became our national language in 1946. Prior to that, our first ever national language was Spanish (during Spanish colonial times), followed by English (during American colonial times). Before Spanish colonization there was no "Filipino" language. We weren't even an established country at the time. It wasnt until 1937 that the Institute of National Language chose Tagalog as the best-suited language to standardize throughout the country. Tagalog was adapted into our current official language, Filipino, in order to neutralize it and eliminate its ties from the Tagalog ethnic group of Luzon.</p>
            <p>The idea of a single national language creates a bit of unrest amongst Filipino natives. The Philippines is so linguistically diverse, and Tagalog/Filipino is only truly representative of a small region in Luzon. What about the other regions? Filipino/Tagalog is taught in schools throughout the country, however, native regional languages are what are actually spoken on a daily basis.</p>
            <p>On the right is a map of the major languages of the Philippines by region. Notice why Tagalog/Filipino being the official national language can stir up some tension amongst the people. Clearly all of these languages are almost all equally prevalent throughout the country. And as stated above, there still are many more Filipino languages unaccounted for in this map that also exist today.</p>
