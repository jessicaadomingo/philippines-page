          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>The Philppines has a long colonial history spanning from the early 15th century until the early 20th century.</p>
          <p>The documented history of the Philippines goes as far back as the year 1521, when Spanish explorer (Portuguese native) Ferdinand Magellan reached Limasawa Island in Southern Leyte. In 1556, the entire archipelago was claimed as <em>Las Islas Filipinas</em> (the Philippian Islands), named after the Spanish King at the time, Philip II. From this point on, the Philippines was an established country, led under Spanish rule. A major motivation in claiming the Philippines under Spanish rule was to eradicate the spread of the Islam faith that had reached the Filipino archipelago via trading relations with Islamic peoples. The Spanish of course was a Christian country, and wanted to instill their religious beliefs in Asia. The Spanish accomplished their task. The Philippines became a Christian majority country, with only Mindinao, the lowest region of the Philippines, remaining an Islamic majority region.</p>
          <p>Beyond just religious influence, the Spanish managed to alter nearly every aspect of Filipino culture and life, including building new infastructure in the country, running and managing schools, implementing taxes on Filipino natives, and influencing Filipino customs/traditions. They even heavily influenced the medium of communication used throughout the country. Spanish became the first ever national language of the Philippines. In addition, the indigenous scripture used for native Filipino languages, Baybayin, was also changed to be written in the Roman alphabet. Filipino autonomy was lost.</p>
          <p>It is still controversial whether Spanish colonization was beneficial or detrimental to the Philippines. Some justify the corruption by recognizing the arrival of the Christian faith as a result of Spanish colonization. Regardless of any speculation, it is undeniable that Spanish colonization in the Phillippines left Filipino natives in a restless state. The want for independence was on the rise.</p>
