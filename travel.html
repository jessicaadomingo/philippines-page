                    <p>Kalanggaman is a small island whose beach stretches out in a straight line, cutting through the ocean. Accessible by small boat, this island is a great day to spend the day and bask in the nature of the Philippines. Both shores are only meters apart, leaving you with the feeling of being deep within an ocean, while still remaining on land.</p>
